          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Since the corona virus situation came along I had a lot of time to think about life,
              specially about what <em>really matters</em> in it for me.<br>
              It just came to me, really clearly, that I´m not happy at my job right now,
              and it is being like this for a long time now.<br>
              Of course is really good to have stability at work get a pay check at the end of the month,
              but it seems an empty way of living do something that does not bring me joy while I wait for my salary.</p>
            <p>I don´t remeber the last time I woke up with a <em>real will</em> to get to get to work...
              it´s just something I do beacause it have to be done, like cleaning the dishes.
              Having time to stay at home woth my wife made me realize that I already have <strong>everything</strong> I nedd to live
              a meanigfull and happy life.
              Some things that were really important to my for the last years are losing they meaning...
              So, why not to <em>stick whith what means</em> and start changing everything else? <br>
              I have nothing to lose and, besides that, new experiences are always welcome to me.
              After all, destiny is the way.

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>About two weeks ago I decided to experience a <strong>big change</strong> in my life.<br>
              It`s not that things are going bad, not at all. But <em>average is not enough</em>.<br>
              Since nobody knows if we gonna have another life, I decided to start big changes in mine,
              both personal and professional.<br>
              I realised that I do not want to spend the next thirty or forty years of work
              doing the same thing that I did for the last twelve years,
              mostly because I don`t feel that is changing nobodys life for better (specialy mine).
            </p>
            <p>My goal  right now is to learn how to code to be able to create something that
              can <em>help people</em> on they dayly basis duties
              and <em>bring them joyfull experiences</em>.<br>
              To achieve this goal, I`ll strive my best!
